SIGN TO ALPHABET CONVERTOR

Sign Language Framework-Flask Library-Mediapipe ML-RandomForest

The Alphabet to Sign Language Converter is a real-time application that translates hand gestures corresponding to the English alphabet into their respective letters. Built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, this project leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide an interactive platform for learning and practicing the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet.

FEATURES

Real-Time Gesture Recognition: 

Captures hand gestures via a webcam and predicts the corresponding letter in real-time.

Multiple Modes:

Offers Easy, Medium, Hard, and Freestyle modes to cater to users of varying skill levels.

Interactive Web Interface: 

Built using Flask, the interface provides a live video feed and allows users to switch between modes.

Machine Learning Model: 

Uses a pre-trained Random Forest classifier (random_forest.joblib) to predict letters based on hand landmarks.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python: The core programming language used for the project.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the application's interface.

OpenCV: Used for real-time image processing and video capture.

Mediapipe: A library for hand detection and landmark extraction.

Random Forest: A machine learning algorithm used for letter prediction.

Joblib: Used for saving and loading the trained model.

ACKNOWLWDGMENTS

Mediapipe: For providing an excellent library for hand detection and landmark extraction.

Flask: For making it easy to build a web interface for the application.

Scikit-Learn: For providing the Random Forest classifier implementation.
